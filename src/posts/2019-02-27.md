I've made a couple of small contributions to Node.js in the past. These were
quite esoteric, and unlikely to be discovered or noticed by most developers.
Recently I made [a contribution][1] which might be noticed though.

Most Node developers are familiar with [Express][2]. When responding to a client
request in Express, _chaining_ makes setting the status and sending a body
fluent. It is possible to chain the call to `send` after the call to `status`
because `status` returns `res`.

```javascript
// Express version.
function requestHandler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).send('Hello, world!');
}
```

The vanilla Node analogue is a little more verbose because `writeHead` had no
explicit return (which means it returned `undefined`).

```javascript
// Vanilla Node.
function requestHandler(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello, world!');
}
```

I find the repetition a little annoying, and frequently tried to chain the call
to `end` onto the call to `writeHead` by mistake.

My contribution was to make `writeHead` return the response object `res`, to
enable method chaining.

```javascript
// Node 11.10.0+
function requestHandler(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200).end('Hello, world!');
}
```

This makes the vanilla Node API for server responses just a little more
friendly.

I made the source code for this site public! You can find it
[here](https://github.com/qubyte/qubyte-codes/). I've
[written at length](/tags/aboutthisblog) about how I've built this, and having
the code makes it easier to point to particular lines. Who knows? Perhaps it'll
inspire _you_ to do the same!

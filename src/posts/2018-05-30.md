In celebration of the Battenberg theme, here is an animated Battenberg! It's
made of two SVG paths composed of lines and arcs. These are calculated using
three angles and a bucket load of trigonometry (I'm not as good as I used to be
at trig). A `requestAnimationFrame` loop updates these angles and the paths.
Click on start to begin the animation. You can tweek the angular speeds using
the three number inputs.

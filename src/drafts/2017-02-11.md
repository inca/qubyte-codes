title: "Promises: Introduction"
---
Promises are an increasingly important part of life as a JavaScript programmer.
Promises are a mechanism which lives on top of callback, which both helps to
manage asynchronous code and gives APIs which do asynchronous work a standard to
use.

When I first came across promises I resisted them. I was familiar with the
Node.js error-first callback convention. With time though, Promises were
formalised as part of the JavaScript specification and they began to crop up
more and more frequently.

It took me a long time to fully grasp promises. Their behaviour seems
complicated, but as my understanding grew, so did my appreciation. The
intricacies of promises lead to some very clever behaviour, and I have found
that I don't need a library to handle synchronous code like I used to with
callbacks.

This series of blog posts attempts to introduce and describe promises, and show
how to use them. The parts are:

 - The basics: Getting started with a promise based API.
 - Promise chains: A deeper dive into the `then` method.
 - Creating promises: How to wrap callbacks in a promise.
 - Promise patterns: Parallelism and managing state.
 - The future is now: Using async-await, and why it makes promises more
   important.

When promises were standardized as part of JavaScript, another feature,
_generator functions_, was too. A generator function is a special kind of
function which returns a generator object. Generator function have a special
`yield` keyword. When it is encountered, the function suspends. The generator
object has a `next` method, which provides a way of both resuming the function,
and obtaining yielded values.

```javascript
function* abc() {
  yield 'a';
  yield 'b';
}

var ayebeesee = abc();

console.log(ayebeesee.next().value); // "a"
console.log(ayebeesee.next().value); // "b"
```

There doesn't seem to be much point in this from the above, but it provides all
the essentials for working with unbounded lists. A classic example is the
Fibonacci series.

```javascript
function* fibonacci() {
  let previous = 1;
  let current = 1;

  yield previous;
  yield current;

  while (true) {
    [previous, current] = [current, previous + current];
    yield current;
  }
}

const fib = fibonacci();

console.log(fib.next().value); // 1
console.log(fib.next().value); // 1
console.log(fib.next().value); // 2
console.log(fib.next().value); // 3
```

Perhaps this doesn't seem so interesting either. It gets interesting when this
interacts with various new features of JavaScript which interact with iterable
objects:

```javascript
const firstFive = [];

for (const num of fibonacci()) {
  firstFive.push(num);

  if (firstFive.length === 5) {
    break;
  }
}

console.log(firstFive); // [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
```

Destructuring assignment also works with it:

```javascript
const [a, b, c, d, e] = fibonacci();

console.log(a, b, c, d, e); // 1 1 2 3 5
```

This still might seem rather academic, and in truth it is unusual to encounter
code which naturally benefits from generator functions. However, what if you
were to mix promises with them?

It turns out that you can mix promises and generators in such a way that a
promise can be yielded, and an async runner function will call `next` upon the
generator object when the promise resolves. A popular library which does this is
`co`.

```javascript
co.spawn(function* doAThing() {
  let resolution;

  try {
    resolution = yield somePromise;
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('The promise rejected with: ' + e.stack);
    return;
  }

  console.log('the promise resolved with: ' + resolution);
});
```

`co.spawn` knows yo wait for `somePromise` to resolve before restarting
the generator, and can send the resolution value in for assignment. Throws can
be manipulated in a similar way. Something quite remarkable has been achieved
here... this code is asynchronous, yet callbacks and indentation (except for the
wrapping) are completely avoided.

The 2017 JavaScript standard provides some syntax sugar for the above.

```javascript
async function doAThing() {
  let resolution;

  try {
    resolution = await somePromise;
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('The promise rejected with: ' + e.stack);
    return;
  }

  console.log('the promise resolved with: ' + resolution);
}
```

It looks almost the same, except `co.spawn` and the generator function have been
replaced with an async function. Within async functions, a special new `await`
keyword is available. This keyword will apply `Promise.resolve` the its right
hand side, and when the resultant promise resolves, it will assign the
resolution value to its left hand side. If the promise rejects, then await
converts the rejection to a throw.

From the outside, async functions are indistinuishable from a regular function
which returns a promise. The very simplest example:

```javascript
async function simplest() {
  return undefined;
}
```

desugars to:

```javascript
function simplest() {
  return Promise.resolve(undefined);
}
```

Something more complex like:

```javascript
function doAFetch(url) {
  return fetch(url)
    .then(res => {
      if (!res.ok) {
        throw new Error(`Unexpected status code: ${res.status}`);
      }

      return res.text();
    });
}
```

can be rewritten as

```javascript
async function doAFetch(url) {
  const res = await fetch(url);

  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Unexpected status code: ${res.status}`);
  }

  const text = await res.text();

  return text;
}
```

In the last post I promised a pattern for promises in series. This can be
difficult to manage with promises on their own, but becomes more obvious with
async functions:

```javascript
async function fetchInSeries(urls) {
  const results = [];

  for (const url of urls) {
    const text = await doAFetch(url);

    results.push(text);
  }

  return results;
}
```

The concurrent version would be

```javascript
async function fetchConcurrently(urls) {
  const results = await Promise.all(urls.map(doAFetch));

  return results;
}
```

The beauty of async function and many of the recent additions to JS is that they
make it possible to use the good old features of JavaScript like branching and
loops in async code.

title: "Base class for a game"
---

I recently decided to code a simple game as a side project. I've already built
an arcade stick, so now it's time to get down to coding!

When it comes to games, class hierarchies can get gnarly pretty quickly.
Nevertheless, it makes sense to have a base class from which all objects in the
game inherit. I came up with this:

```javascript
const instances = new Set();

export default class Node {
  constructor() {
    instances.add(this);
  }

  destroy() {
    instances.remove(this);
  }

  update() {
    throw new Error('Extensions of Node must have an update method.');
  }

  draw() {
    throw new Error('Extensions of Node must have a draw method.');
  }

  static* [Symbol.iterator]() {
    for (const instance of instances) {
      if (instance instanceof this) {
        yield instance;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This class has access to `instances` which is, unsurprisingly, a set of all
instances. The static property allows this class to be iterated over. The way
I've set this up is slightly clever though. Classes which extend `Node` will
inherit iteration along with it, but when iterating the elements which are not
instances of the child class are filtered out.

```javascript
class Child extends Node {}
class GrandChild extends Child {}

var node = new Node();
var child = new Child();
var grandChild = new GrandChild();

// Logs:
// Node
// Child
// GrandChild
for (const node of Node) {
  console.log(node.constructor.name);
}

// Logs:
// Child
// GrandChild
for (const node of Child) {
  console.log(node.constructor.name);
}

// Logs:
// GrandChild
for (const node of GrandChild) {
  console.log(node.constructor.name);
}
```

Internally this filtering is done by checking `instanceof`, which is itself
customizable with a symbol.

I really like this pattern. All iteration is handled for child classes of Node,
which avoids a lot of repetition. The one potentially major drawback is that
iteration is always over all nodes, which has obvious potential performance
implications.

Another problem with this pattern is that the `destroy` method becomes necessary
in order to remove elements from the set of all nodes.

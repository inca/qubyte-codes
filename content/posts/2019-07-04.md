I mentioned [a new service which handles webmentions][webmention.app] in a
[previous post][previous-post]. I decided to replace
[the glitch I've been using][old-glitch] for
[one which is much leaner][new-glitch]. It uses
[the library which powers webmention.app][wm] to handle webmention (and also
older technologies like pingback) endpoint discovery and mention dispatch so I
took this opportunity to ditch my own discovery code.

I also decided to leave out some features. The earlier glitch would check old
posts for new mentions, filter out certain URLs like rendered webmentions from
others and so on. This all required a database and meant that posts got checked
more than once, which took a long time (beyond the timeout of a glitch run.

The new glitch keeps a list of posts it's already sent mentions for. This means
that each post is only scanned once after publication. That avoids the issue of
filtering out certain URLs (the rendered webmentions of others for example)
since a newly published post won't have any mentions yet. It's also a little
more portable. If you like the idea of using a sitemap.txt to drive a record of
which posts have been handled, then [take a look][new-glitch]!

P.S. All the glitches I use to add functionality to my blog can be found
[here][glitches].

I really like webmentions. They provide a way to let folk know that you're
writing about their blog posts. I see them as an alternative to comments which
encourages better discourse.

Webmentions can be a pain to manage though, especially if you have a statically
generated site like this. For receiving mentions there's the venerable
[webmention.io](webmention.io) service. I use this to collect mentions and then
I check periodically and copy mentions over to the metadata of the targeted
post.

To dispatch webmentions I
[made a glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/send-webmentions), which I've
[written about before](/blog/about-this-blog-3). It's closely coupled to the URL
structure of my blog and how it compiles webmentions into pages, so I'll stick
with it but it's not so useful for others except as a reference.

If you've just decided to include webmentions on your blog, then Remy Sharp
created [webmention.app](https://webmention.app) to automate searching for links
and dispatching webmentions for a page. If I were starting now I'd use it!

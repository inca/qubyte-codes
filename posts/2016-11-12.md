I recently attended ffconf, and was introduced to `position: sticky;`. Support
for it is patchy, but where not available the header will scroll out of view as
it did in the past. Where available, the navbar will stick to the top of the
window when the rest of the header is scrolled out of view.

This is a pure CSS solution, so this blog once again serves no JavaScript! the
only thing which I wanted that CSS does not provide is a selector for elements
in the stuck state.

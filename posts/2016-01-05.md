I touched briefly on the technology used in this blog in
[a previous post](/blog/about-this-blog.html), but I didn't explain the motivation behind a lot of
the choices I made when building it. I'd like to do that in this post.

## HTTPS

It doesn't matter that this blog is entirely benign. The privacy of my readers must be respected.
HTTPS is essential, and thankfully [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is now here to offer
free certificates. The process is a bit manual for servers using NGINX, but I expect that to improve
with time.

## Tracking

I don't currently use Google Analytics for tracking. It doesn't sit well from a privacy perspective.

## Dates on posts

I come across a lot of articles with no dates. This frustrates me, because it's not obvious if the
information in them might be stale. Of course, my posts had to be dated in an obvious way.

## Getting to the point

There are some blogs and platforms out there (medium is an example) which slap a huge title and/or a
big pointless image before the text starts. The reader is forced to scroll before they can begin to
read. This is unnecessary and irritating. I designed the CSS such that, even on an older mobile
device like the iPhone 4, it is possible to begin reading without scrolling.

## Statically generated posts

Yes yes, I love JS rendering DOM in the browser just like you, but only when appropriate. Delivering
complete HTML pages to the browser is an accessibility win, and kinder to batteries. It also means
no rendering on the server or need for a database. Everyone wins.

## No comments

Comments entail complexity. If I hand rolled them, then I'd need to use a database. If I went with
a service, then that means more requests and rendering for the browser. I'm not convinced that
comments are even worth it. If something is really worth saying you tweet to me. If that's too
small, then tweet me a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or use [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/). There
are downsides to this approach. It's not obvious when a question has already been asked or a point
already made. I'll cross that bridge if this blog becomes popular enough to suffer such issues.
